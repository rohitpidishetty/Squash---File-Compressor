🚀 Introducing Squash – My File Compression Software
I’m excited to introduce my 130 project Squash, software that is focused on building a custom file compression engine from the ground up. Squash explores core compression concepts such as Huffman-based encoding, efficient file I/O, structured metadata handling, and reliable encode/decode pipelines, with an emphasis on understanding real-world performance and storage trade-offs. As a founder-led build, this project sharpened my skills in low-level systems engineering and data optimization, and reinforced how impactful software is created by balancing speed, efficiency, and reliability.
